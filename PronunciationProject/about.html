          <p>
            We are a group of teachers dedicated to helping learners by providing a place to learn and practice their pronunciation. What is generally taught in text-books and in schools is quite different that what the learners hear in the real world. Therefore it is essential that they are exposed to the real sounds of English from the beginning to aid in their language development.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
The "Pronunciation Project" site is divided into 3 levels. The first level covers the rudimentary pronunciation of items such as the alphabet, vowels, dipthongs, etc. <br><br>
The second level focuses primarily on single word vocabulary pronunciation and other nuances of the spoken language.<br><br>
Finally, the third level puts everything together showing the importance of connected speech, sound conversions and added (extra) sounds that have no meaning but can cause great confusion to learners of the language.

            <p>The Pronunciation Project is ongoing in nature and will continue to grow and as needed, more information will be added to the site. If you are a teacher and want to provide insites or share pronunciation tips, we hope to provide you with that platform to do so here.</p>
